(NOTE: IN BETA) 
A quality-of-life mod that adds and tweaks some items to make game progression a little smoother
This mod is designed to be "Vanilla+", meaning it stays closely to the feel of the base game while only tweaking a few things

Note: There was an old mod called Vanilla Tweaks by Pop000100, which is now outdated as most of the features the mod had are now in the base game or another mod does it better.
*This mod is similar, but is more recent and has different features!*

Features:
- Adds the Leaf Whip and Oak Tome, craftable starter weapons for the Summoner and Mage classes, 
as both melee and ranged have craftable starter weapons.
